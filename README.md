# UnRLGym

under construction!!

Goal : an unreal engine 4 project which provides a collection of environments to play with reinforcement learning algorithms. (...only robot arm environment for now)

When the project starts, a TCP server is launched so that any external program can connect and :
- select an environment
- get the sensor values from the environment
- command the robotic systems in the environment

Tested with :
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2017
- UE 4.26.1

Rely on the ObjectDeliverer (free) plugin to handle TCP communication : https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/objectdeliverer
